    "Heart disease refers to various conditions that affect the heart, including blood vessel disease, irregular heartbeats, heart valve disease, etc. It is responsible for 1 in 4 deaths worldwide across all races and genders, making it one of the major causes of death. Heart disease is sometimes referred to as “silent” because, in many cases, it is not diagnosed until the individual experiences signs or symptoms of a heart attack or heart failure. Since it is difficult to diagnose heart disease before more severe symptoms start to appear, our goal is to predict heart disease diagnosis based on known risk factors like high blood pressure and high cholesterol, so that heart disease can be caught even before symptoms start to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are using is a Heart Disease Data Set (Janosi et al.) that contains information about a person's age, sex, other medical factors and whether the individual was diagnosed with heart disease. The dataset contains 13 variables for which observations were collected and a diagnosis column which is the categorical class we are predicting."

    "Out of the 13 variables in our dataset, five were numerical. We chose to use four of these five: age, max heart rate, resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The fifth, which looks at ST wave depressions caused by exercise, was omitted because it is too complex for our needs, and correctly interpreting its meaning requires significant understanding of the biology of the heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the presence of heart disease, we will use a classification model, trained on the four predictor variables mentioned above. One way we plan to visualize the results is using scatter plots comparing two predictors, with data points colored by diagnosis, and a background color indicating the prediction of the classifier (end of section 5.8 in the textbook)."
