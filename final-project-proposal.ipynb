    "Heart disease refers to various conditions that affect the heart, including blood vessel disease, irregular heartbeats, heart valve disease, etc. It is responsible for 1 in 4 deaths worldwide across all races and genders, making it one of the major causes of death. Heart disease is sometimes referred to as “silent” because, in many cases, it is not diagnosed until the individual experiences signs or symptoms of a heart attack or heart failure. Since it is difficult to diagnose heart disease before more severe symptoms start to appear, our goal is to predict heart disease diagnosis based on known risk factors like high blood pressure and high cholesterol, so that heart disease can be caught even before symptoms start to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are using is a Heart Disease Data Set (Janosi et al.) that contains information about a person's age, sex, other medical factors and whether the individual was diagnosed with heart disease. The dataset contains 13 variables for which observations were collected and a diagnosis column which is the categorical class we are predicting.\n"
